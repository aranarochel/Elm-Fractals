A series of fractal (*or fractal-like*) animations written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/). 

This project was born both by a desire to become more acquainted with Elm and to dip my feet in the world of algorithmic art making. Inspired by the growing number of artists incorporating  algorithmic processes and concepts in their works, this set of animations together form one single art piece meant to viewed as an installation on several monitors.

Each animation has its own elm source file associate with it, located in the [src](https://github.com/aranarochel/Elm-Fractals/tree/master/src) directory.

The animations can be compiled to html using the elm-compiler, or you can simply navigate to the [html](https://github.com/aranarochel/Elm-Fractals/tree/master/html) folder and open any file in your browser to view them.
